# This .gitignore file should be placed at the root of your Unity project folder.
#
# It tells Git to ignore certain files and folders that are generated by Unity,
# your IDE, or your operating system, and that should not be committed to your
# version control repository.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# and other generated data. This folder can be very large and should
# never be committed. Unity will regenerate it.

# Temp folder: Contains temporary files generated during builds or asset imports.
/Temp/

# Obj folder: Generated by Visual Studio for C# project compilation.

# Build folder: Typically where your game builds are outputted.
